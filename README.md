# Component Maintenance Interest Group

This repository holds templates and guidelines to support the maintenance of projects in the [Samvera](https://github.com/samvera) Github organization.

## Samvera Core Components

Samvera Core Components are defined as the following:

> The primary Samvera code repository contains the Samvera communityâ€™s current consensus on what we are using, maintaining, and recommending. Ideally, this repository only contains code modules that are being actively used and maintained.

_Please reference [A Guide for the Samvera Community](https://samvera.github.io/core_components.html) for further information._

Currently, there are eighteen Samvera Core Components maintained by the community:

1. [active_fedora](https://github.com/samvera/active_fedora)

## Samvera Component Templates

[README.md](./templates/README.md) - The elements in this template should be in
every repository. Additional elements may be added.

[SUPPORT.md](./templates/SUPPORT.md) - Copy this and replace `{{library}}` with
the repository name. This is linked from the README and has information on how
to create an issue, email the list, and connect to Slack.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](./templates/CONTRIBUTING.md) - Contribution guidelines for
Samvera projects. Should be included. Minimal customization should be necessary.

[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - Should be included
verbatim in every Samvera repository. If this is updated, it needs to be
distributed to all Samvera organization repositories.

[LICENSE](./templates/LICENSE) - Should be included in every Samvera
repository. The copyright statements may change as appropriate. This template
was taken from guidelines found on the
[wiki](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Code+Copyright+Statement).

[MAILMAP](./templates/MAILMAP) - A master template for [git mailmap](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-check-mailmap).
This template is something to push to all samvera repositories. The goal in
applying a common mailmap is to help understand contributions as people move
and change roles/functions/laptops.

## Ruby Scripts

There exist Ruby scripts in this repository that can be used to propagate some of these templates:

### Querying for Gem Metadata

This queries for and prints to the `STDOUT` Gem metadata for each Samvera repository:

```bash
$ bundle exec ruby bundled-gem-release-dates.rb
```

The output is formatted using the following structure:

```bash
# Read through the current directories list of bundled gems. Capture
# each gem's specification. Sort the specifications by version release
# date, and print one line per gem. Note, this takes some time to run.
#
# Example:
#
#   2020-06-11  1.40.0  rubocop-rspec
#   2020-06-11  1.329.0 aws-partitions
#   2020-06-12  3.99.2  aws-sdk-core
#   2020-06-12  1.0.1   ldp
```

### Updating Gem Ownership Permissions

This ensures that a list maintained within this repository have the proper permissions for all Samvera repositories:

```bash
$ bundle exec ruby grant_revoke_gem_authority.rb
```

One may also explicitly request that all existing ownership permissions be revoked before adding permissions for each Gem:

```bash
$ WITH_REVOKE=true bundle exec ruby ./script/grant_revoke_gem_authority.rb
```
