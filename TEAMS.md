| [maintenance](https://github.com/orgs/samvera/teams/maintenance) | Current, active members of the Component Maintenance Interest Group |

## Samvera Labs
| Team | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [admins](https://github.com/orgs/samvera-labs/teams/admins) | Users with administrative privileges for the Samvera Labs Organization |

## Administrators (Admins)
GitHub Organizations distinguish between [owners](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/maintaining-ownership-continuity-for-your-organization) and [moderators](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-moderators-in-your-organization). Members of the `admins` Team are possess both of these privileges.

## Contributors
By default, all other [members](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#organization-members) of an Organization should belong to the `contributors` Team. As there are currently no requirement to be added as a `member` to any of the Samvera Organizations, there is no existing process for admitting new `members`.

## Membership Audits
While there is no formal process for auditing GitHub Organization membership, those `members` of Samvera Organizations who are no longer actively contributing to or in contact with the community should be contacted. Failing to receive any response, should these persons have contributed to any project in the past, they should be moved to the `emerita` Team. Otherwise, removing these persons from the `contributors` Team (along with their membership to the `samvera` and `samvera-labs`) is the best recommended practice.
