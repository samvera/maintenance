# Samvera GitHub Organizations

Samvera Community projects are currently organized between the following three GitHub Organizations:

- https://github.com/samvera
- https://github.com/samvera-labs
- https://github.com/samvera-deprecated

## Samvera

Currently, projects under active maintenance (including the Core Components) are managed within this Organization. Aside from the Core Components, this consists of the following:

| Project                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Samvera Labs

As stated on the public page, these projects constitute experiments, works-in-progress, and beta versions of gems and apps. Currently, the Component Maintenance Interest Group is not chartered to maintain, support, or evaluate any projects within the Samvera Labs Organization.

## Samvera Deprecated

As described on the Organization page, this contains older gems, apps, and experiments that we no longer recommend deploying in production but that may be useful for sample code or reference. Aside from the [process for deprecating a Core Component](https://samvera.github.io/deprecation.html), projects within this are not modified by the Component Maintenance Interest Group.
