# Component Maintenance Interest Group

This repository holds templates and guidelines to support the maintenance of projects in the [Samvera](https://github.com/samvera) Github organization.

## GitHub Project

Tasks for the ongoing maintenance efforts currently being undertaken by members of the Samvera Community are tracked and regularly updated using the [Samvera Component Maintenance Project](https://github.com/orgs/samvera/projects/28/views/3).

## Samvera Core Components

Samvera Core Components are defined as the following:

> The primary Samvera code repository contains the Samvera communityâ€™s current consensus on what we are using, maintaining, and recommending. Ideally, this repository only contains code modules that are being actively used and maintained.

_Please reference [A Guide for the Samvera Community](https://samvera.github.io/core_components.html) for further information._

Currently, there are twenty Samvera Core Components maintained by the community:

## Maintenance Documentation

- [ORGS](./ORGS.md) - Reference guide for the structure of GitHub Organizations (`samvera`, `samvera-labs`, and `samvera-deprecated`)
- [TEAMS](./TEAMS.md) - Reference guide for the structure of GitHub Teams within the `samvera`, `samvera-labs`, and `samvera-deprecated` Organizations
- [RELEASES](./ruby/RELEASES.md) - Reference guide for the releasing Ruby Gem components maintained by the Samvera Community

## Samvera Component Templates

[README.md](./templates/README.md) - The elements in this template should be in
every repository. Additional elements may be added.

[SUPPORT.md](./templates/SUPPORT.md) - Copy this and replace `{{library}}` with
the repository name. This is linked from the README and has information on how
to create an issue, email the list, and connect to Slack.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](./templates/CONTRIBUTING.md) - Contribution guidelines for
Samvera projects. Should be included. Minimal customization should be necessary.

[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - Should be included
verbatim in every Samvera repository. If this is updated, it needs to be
distributed to all Samvera organization repositories.

[LICENSE](./templates/LICENSE) - Should be included in every Samvera
repository. The copyright statements may change as appropriate. This template
was taken from guidelines found on the
[wiki](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Code+Copyright+Statement).

[MAILMAP](./templates/MAILMAP) - A master template for [git mailmap](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-check-mailmap).
This template is something to push to all samvera repositories. The goal in
applying a common mailmap is to help understand contributions as people move
and change roles/functions/laptops.

## Ruby Scripts

There exist Ruby scripts in this repository that can be used to propagate some of these templates. These are located within `ruby/scripts/`:

### Querying for Gem Metadata

This queries for and prints to the `STDOUT` Gem metadata for each Samvera repository:

```bash
$ bundle exec ruby ./ruby/script/bundled-gem-release-dates.rb
```

The output is formatted using the following structure:

```bash
# Read through the current directories list of bundled gems. Capture
# each gem's specification. Sort the specifications by version release
# date, and print one line per gem. Note, this takes some time to run.
#
# Example:
#
#   2020-06-11  1.40.0  rubocop-rspec
#   2020-06-11  1.329.0 aws-partitions
#   2020-06-12  3.99.2  aws-sdk-core
#   2020-06-12  1.0.1   ldp
```

### Updating Gem Ownership Permissions

This ensures that a list maintained within this repository have the proper permissions for all Samvera repositories:

```bash
$ bundle exec ruby ./ruby/script/grant_revoke_gem_authority.rb
```

One may also explicitly request that all existing ownership permissions be revoked before adding permissions for each Gem:

```bash
$ WITH_REVOKE=true bundle exec ruby ./ruby/script/grant_revoke_gem_authority.rb
```

## Contributing

If you're working on PR for this project, create a feature branch off of `main`.

This repository follows the [Samvera Community Code of Conduct](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405212316/Code+of+Conduct) and [language recommendations](https://github.com/samvera/maintenance/blob/main/templates/CONTRIBUTING.md#language). Please **_do not_** create a branch called `master` for this repository or as part of your pull request; the branch will either need to be removed or renamed before it can be considered for inclusion in the code base and history of this repository.
